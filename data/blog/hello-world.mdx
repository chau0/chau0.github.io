---

Welcome! I’m Le Chau — a developer with 10+ years of experience, now shifting gears to build indie tools that reflect both technical depth and personal meaning.

### Why This Blog?

For years, I’ve worked across stacks, shipped products, and solved hard problems for companies. But recently, I’ve been pulled toward something more personal: building **useful automation tools**, **sharing my journey**, and exploring **mindful, meaningful tech creation**.

This blog is where I’ll:

- ✍️ Write about building SaaS and AI-powered tools from scratch
- 🔧 Share technical breakdowns, stack choices, and lessons learned
- 📈 Experiment with monetization (my near-term goal: $100 MRR)
- 🧘 Reflect on deeper themes — like philosophy, meditation, and staying sane as a solo dev

### Current Focus

Right now, I’m building:

- A blog content writing assistant powered by LLMs
- A podcast generator that turns websites into audio
- A personal coding framework focused on "vibe" and flow

All on a shoestring budget — using free-tier cloud infra, serverless APIs, and open tools.

### Building in Public

I believe in **sharing early, sharing often**. This blog is part journal, part knowledge base, and part playground. If any of my tools help others save time or find clarity, that’s a win.

If you're into indie hacking, AI automation, or mindful tech — I’d love to connect.

Thanks for reading 🙏  
– Chau
